        Take what you got and leave now
        You're wearing out your welcome
        No one here wants to see you, hear you
        Think that you won from day one
        But soon the devil will come
        You know just why he wants you, don't you?
        You're crooked desire left us in disarray
        Misguided, divided at the point of no return
        You started a fire, you're gonna watch it burn
        Try to save yourself like you always do
        Every bridge we build
        You think it's yours to burn it down, just burn it down
        When everything is gone
        You'll wish you only heard us out, heard us out
        Screaming Mayday
        Mayday
        Act like you've only done good
        Unfairly miss understood?
        Play the victim it's so you, what's new?
        Lie after lie after lie
        We all stopped counting the crimes
        You know why we can't trust you, don't you?
        You're crooked desire left us in disarray
        Misguided, divided at the point of no return
        You started a fire, you're gonna watch it burn
        Try to save yourself like you always do
        Every bridge we build
        You think it's yours to burn it down, just burn it down
        When everything is gone
        You'll wish you only heard us out, heard us out
        Why don't you choke on yourself
        Swallow the hate or just fucking go
        You set yourself the world on fire
        Rising higher and higher
        But there's no where to run
        Because all of the bridges burned
        All you are is a fucking monster a walking disaster
        You touch it you break it you kill it
        Just like a cureless cancer
        Every bridge we build
        You think it's yours to burn it down
        When everything is gone
        You'll wish you only heard us out, heard us out
        Every bridge we build
        You think it's yours to burn it down, just burn it down
        When everything is gone
        You'll wish you only heard us out, heard us out
        Screaming Mayday
        Mayday
        Mayday
        Mayday
